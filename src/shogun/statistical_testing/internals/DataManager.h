/**
 * @brief Class DataManager for fetching/streaming test data block-wise.
 * It can handle data coming from multiple sources. The number of data
 * sources is represented by the num_distributions parameter in the constructor
 * of the data manager. It can handle heterogenous data sources, and it can
 * stream multiple blocks per burst, as the computation would require. The size
 * of the blocks and the number of blocks to be fetched per burst can be set
 * externally.
 *
 * This class is designed to be used on a stack. An instance of DataManager
 * should not be serialzied or copied or moved around. In Shogun, it is helpful
 * when used inside just the implementation inside a PIMPL.
