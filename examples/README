NOTE: We will soon transition to using meta-examples only. The below folders
and old example machanics will be deleted then.

Undocumented examples are contained in the "undocumented" directory. Documented
examples can be generated by running make. This will prepend the descriptions
contained in "descriptions" in front of each example. The resulting documented
examples can then be found in the "documented" directory.

Note that in the (un)documented directories a symbolic link to a number of data
sets contained "data" is required to run the examples.
